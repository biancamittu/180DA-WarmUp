- Using MQTT, efficient and asynchronous communication is made possible through the publisher/subscriber model
- However, MQTT can lack extensive security measures
- I would expect a reasonable lag time to be between 0.1 and 1 second(s)
- I do not personally prefer a different method of communication at this point, but that may change when we incorporate multiplayer functionality

- Performance of the speech recognition takes a hit when the trigger words are not distinct enough from each other and sound similar

- In noisy environments, the system becomes less sensitive to what the user is saying and it does not detect words with the same accuracy
- To mitigate this external factor, users can utilize a microphone plug-in as opposed to just the built-in microphone on the computer

- In Golf Wizards, we can use speech recognition to start the game, end the game, navigate around the main menu, and cast spells

- Since the speech recognition plays a small factor in the grand scheme of our game, we would like it to be straightforward and easy to use

- It needs to be fairly quick and accurate, so players can watch the impact of their spells in a timely manner
- A missed recognition diminishes the “magical” aspect of the game, which plays a large role in the storyline, so it is important that our software is accurate

- The speech recognition mostly impacts the graphics of the game, not hardware
