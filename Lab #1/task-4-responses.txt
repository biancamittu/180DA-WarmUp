Task #4 Responses

1.  I found that HSV format worked better than RGB format.
    The color range I used was [110, 50, 50] to [130, 255, 255]
2.  In general, the better the lighting, the better the detection function worked.
3.  In general, the higher the brightness on my phone, the better the detection function worked.
4.  In general, more concentrated forms of color that are less impacted by external lighting are more robust. So, the phone color swatch resulted in better detection than the coffee cup.
