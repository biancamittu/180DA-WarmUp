To design graphics for my project, I will...

- Plan the layout by determining the interface elements needed, such as buttons, sliders, and text fields
- Create visual representations by designing the golf course terrain, obstacles, and holes
- Implement interactive elements to allow users to adjust shot angle and power
- Enhance aesthetics by incorporating color schemes, textures, and animations to create an immersive and visually appealing experience for players
