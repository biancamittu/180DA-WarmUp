To design graphics for my project, I will...

- Plan the layout by determining the interface elements needed, such as buttons, sliders, and text fields
- Create visual representations by design the golf course terrain, obstacles, and holes
- Implement interactive elements to allow users to adjust shot angle, power, and club selection for each stroke
Add feedback mechanisms: Provide real-time feedback on shot accuracy, distance, and score to enhance player engagement.
Enhance aesthetics: Incorporate color schemes, textures, and animations to create an immersive and visually appealing experience for players.
